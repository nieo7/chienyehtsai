            <p>　　Kaohsiung Office was founded in August of 1999. Due to its long-term relationship with accountants, Kaohsiung Office has been well known for its distinct capacity to provide clients with legal advisory services in a wide range of practice areas, and aims to offer an integrated, one-stop solution to our clients' legal, commercial, and accounting inquiries. Kaohsiung Office has experiences in various practice areas, including but not limited to legal consultation; civil, criminal and administrative litigation; Initial Public Offering (IPO) for both domestic and overseas companies; and due diligence consultation for capital transactions.</p><br>
            <p>　　In addition, since the establishment of the Kaohsiung Office, we have served as the legal counselors of Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation's Route C2 station project under the leadership of Attorney C.Y. Tsai.  As of today, we continue to advise on KRTC's Route C3 station project.  In that capacity, we have extensive experiences with construction cases and commercial arbitration. The Act for Promotion of Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects is the source of law for construction of KRTC's Route; it provides the method for private enterprises to be involved in building, operating and transferring public projects. The promulgation of the Act for Promotion of Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects saw an increase in infrastructure projects operated under the Act.  Kaohsiung Office has participated in countless such projects and is now one of the most experienced public construction legal counselors in South Taiwan.</p><br>
            <p>　　Current events are highly changeable and rules of law numerous and complex. Only through professional specialization, teamwork, enthusiasm, and devotion of services can we provide our clients with trusted services. Kaohsiung Office keeps current with social events, possesses expertise, and improves our quality legal services to our clients by professional specialization and teamwork.  As a service to our clients we often hold legal seminars to provide legal updates to the community. </p><br>
