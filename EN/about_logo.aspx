            <p>Mr. Alex C.Y. Tsai managed the Firm with total devotion.  Unfortunately, Mr. Tsai passed away on February 26, 2011.  Mr. Tsai taught us that "in addition to being well connected, a good lawyer especially must possess fairness, justness, honesty, professionalism, capability and quality of work."  Mr. Tsai encouraged our colleagues to "persist in professionalism, manage business with small capital, service the good, live in peace, and enjoy work."  In memory of Mr. Alex C.Y. Tsai, Kaohsiung Office changed its E-mail address from "chienyeh" to "chienyehtsai" on July 1st, 2011 and designed a new logo with the words "C.Y. Tsai" embedded within the logo.  In addition, the website for Kaohsiung Office is now <a href="http://www.chienyehtsai.com.tw/" style="text-decoration:none; color:#59493f;">http://www.chienyehtsai.com.tw/</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>"Although the ancients had passed away, they remained exemplary role models forever and ever."  The work of predecessors benefits the successors.  We shall persist in our efforts with a view towards continuous growth and sustainable development.</p><br>
