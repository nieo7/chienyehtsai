            <div id="content_about">
            <p>　　Founded by Dr. S.S. Tzeng, LL.D, in Taipei, Taiwan in 1973, Chien Yeh Law Offices (hereinafter referred to as the "Firm") was originally named "Chien Yeh Associated Law Offices."  The Firm thereafter changed to its current name in 2004.</p><br>
            <p>　　The name "Chien Yeh" was chosen jointly by Dr. S.S. Tzeng, LL.D, and Mr. C.L. Lin, CPA, who at the time separately founded Chien Yeh Associated Law Offices and Chien Yeh Associated Certified Public Accountants.  The term "Associated" was originally incorporated into the names of the firms to reflect that, despite the two firms being created as independent entities, they were located on the same premises but at different office space and on different floors to provide their clients the most time- and cost-efficient way of obtaining the fullest consultation services possible.</p><br>
            <p>　　Chien Yeh Associated Law Offices was founded with its principal place of business in Taipei, Taiwan (Registered Number 04140600) and was managed successively by Dr. S.S. Tzeng, Dr. Shen-I Lee, Dr. Carl K.M. Wu, and Mr. Alex C.Y. Tsai.  In 1994, Mr. Alex C.Y. Tsai took over the role of managing partner.  Being from the Fongshan District in Kaohsiung City (originally Fengshan City, Kaohsiung County before the merger of Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County) and at that time leading the legal team in the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation's Route C2 station agreement negotiations in Kaohsiung, Mr. Tsai took the initiative to establish the first branch of Chien Yeh Associated Law Offices, the Kaohsiung Office, in August of 1999 (with office address at 18F-5, No. 211, Chung Cheng 4th Rd., Qianjin Dist., Kaohsiung City 801, Taiwan (R.O.C.)) (hereinafter referred to as "Kaohsiung Office").  Kaohsiung Office values the importance of professional specialization and teamwork and earns the confidence and trust of our clients through patient, modest, and amiable client interactions.</p><br>
            <p>　　Mr. Alex C.Y. Tsai renamed "Chien Yeh Associated Law Offices" to "Chien Yeh Law Offices" and, beyond the Taipei Office, expanded the Firm to Taichung and Kaohsiung.  In addition, a satellite office was established in the Incubator Center at the Tainan Science Park to provide legal services to meet local needs.  Each branch office develops styles that suit the local environment and together provide mutual support to the other branch offices as from time to time necessary.</p><br>
            <p>　　The Kaohsiung Office registered its tax ID number on the first of March, 2004 (Registered Number 99402673).  The next year (2005), the Firm trademarked its name in both Chinese and English.  After Mr. Alex C. Y. Tsai passed away in February 26, 2011, the Firm's Taipei and Taichung Office (Registered Number 04140600) continued to be managed by Attorney Jin and partners, while the Firm's offices in Kaohsiung and at the Incubator Center at the Tainan Science Park (Registered Number 99402673) became separately managed by Attorney Wu and partners, with Dr. Shen-I Lee as Kaohsiung Office's Honorary Managing Partner. When either the Taipei Office or the Kaohsiung Office encounters cases and activities which need assistant counsel, each will call on the other for first-choice support.  Dr. Shen-I Lee encourages our colleagues to continue cooperation and alliance.</p><br>
            <p>　　Chien Yeh Law Offices Kaohsiung Office staffed the satellite office in the Fortune Mall at Pingtung Agricultural Biotechnology Park in December,2012.</p><br>
            <p>　　The Firm withdrew from its satellite office in the Incubator Center at the Tainan Science Park in September 2020.</p>
